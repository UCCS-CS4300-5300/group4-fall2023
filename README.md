## Game Premise
Starship Battle is a strategic game inspired by rock-paper-scissors, featuring starships with unique abilities. Each player starts with 100 health points, and the game is played over a maximum of three rounds.

## Rules
The game involves three actions:
1. **Attack**: Deals damage to the opponent.
2. **Defend**: Blocks the opponent's attack.
3. **Counter**: Effective against defend, but vulnerable to attack.

Each starship has unique values for attack and counter actions, with the sum of both always equaling 30. Game continues until winner is found
